    `rx` is a modern pixel editor implemented in rust.

  Designed with great care and love
    with pixel artists and animators in mind.

OVERVIEW

  `rx` is an extensible, modern and minimalist pixel editor implemented
  in rust[0]. It's designed to have as little UI as possible, and instead
  takes inspiration from vi's[1] modal nature and command mode.

  Compared to other pixel editors, rx aims to be smaller, yet more configurable
  and extendable. `rx` takes a different approach when it comes to animation
  as well, which is done with *strips*.

  See the screenshots/ folder to get an idea of what this looks like.

GOALS

  * Minimal UI. Clean aesthetics. No clutter.
  * Everything that should be controlled by the keyboard, is.
  * Extensible and scriptable with a simple command-based language.
  * Familiar to anyone with vi(m) knowledge.
  * Snappy. No perceptible input lag when painting. All commands run in < 16ms.
  * Optimized for advanced users. No hand-holding. vi-like philosophy.
  * Small, hackable codebase. At most 10 KLOC with only a handful of direct dependencies.
  * First-class Linux support.
  * CPU & memory efficient.

FEATURES

  * Built-in sprite animation support, with live preview.
  * Work with multiple files simultaneously.
  * Extensible command system.
  * Text-based configuration.
  * Built using modern graphics.
  * HiDPI display support.
  * UI scaling.
  * Undo/redo any edit.
  * PNG support.
  * Animated GIF output.
  * Multi-brush / synchronous editing.
  * Brush filtering a.k.a. "pixel-perfect" mode.

  * (Coming soon: Layers)
  * (Coming soon: Visual mode)
  * (Coming soon: Workspaces)

PLATFORM SUPPORT

  * Linux     (vulkan)         [GOOD]
  * macOS     (metal)          [GOOD]
  * Windows   (vulkan)         [OKAY]

BUILD DEPENDENCIES

  * rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  * cmake (https://cmake.org/download/)

  macOS

    * `Xcode` and the `Xcode Command Line Tools` are required.
      The latter can be obtained by running `xcode-select --install`
    * CMake might be required. You can install it with `brew install cmake`.

BUILD & INSTALLATION

  Before proceeding, make sure the BUILD DEPENDENCIES have been installed.

  Then, run:

    $ cargo install --git https://github.com/cloudhead/rx --locked

  This will download `rx` and install it under `~/.cargo/bin/rx`.
  If you prefer a different install location, you can specify it
  via the `--root <prefix>` flag, where <prefix> is for example
  '/usr/local'.

CONFIGURATION

  Configuring `rx` involves editing the `init.rx` script, which is found in a
  platform-dependent location. On Linux, this is in the XDG config directory,
  eg. `~/.config/rx/init.rx`, while on macOS this is in the
  `~/Library/Preferences` folder. If a config file isn't found, the default
  configuration (`config/init.rx`) will be written.

  To get the exact location of the config directory, enter `:echo config/dir`
  from inside `rx`.

USAGE

  After installing, simply run `rx` from a shell or application launcher.

  You can then use the :help command to show the default set of key mappings
  and commands.

  Common commands:

    :help                    Display help
    :e <path..>              Edit path(s)
    :w                       Write/save view
    :q                       Quit view
    :slice <n>               Slice view into <n> frames
    :source <path>           Source an rx script (eg. a palette)
    :f/resize <w> <h>        Resize frames

  For example, to create a 32x32 sprite with 4 frames:

    1. Open `rx`.
    2. Type `:f/resize 32 32`.
    3. Press <return> three times to create a total of four frames.
    4. Zoom in/out with `.` and `,`.
    5. Draw something great!
    6. Type `:w animation.png` to save it.

TROUBLESHOOTING

  If something ain't working like it's supposed to, there are various things you can
  do to debug the problem:

  * Run `rx` with verbose logging, by using the `-v` command-line flag. This
    will log errors from the underlying libraries that are usually suppressed,
    and will show debug output that might indicate what the problem is.
  * If `rx` is crashing, run it with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` set in your environment
    to show a backtrace on crash.
  * It could be that the issue is related to your configuration - in that case
    the program can be run without loading the initialization script like so:

        rx -u -
